# THIS IS AN ARMv7 Build of cpuminer, should be compatible with any armv7/lollipop or later phone. 

#Getting Started
This is a command line utility. You need a terminal emulator. Try com.termux or similar. There are x64 binaries from builds further up the tree. This branch adds a v7a build. Only tested for/on allium for garlicoin. Most everything else should work but there is no guarantee nor any support. There are no donations, original credits left alone.

Run ./cpuminer7 --help for command line. All normal options available.


## Issues
Only allium is a little tested algorithm. You may see bus error crashes. Or worse. This is a work in progress by pure accident.
